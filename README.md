## Features

## Proces log
### Week 1

I started with brainstorming about what kinda of app I was going to make and which API to use. I previously used the Rijksmuseum API, so i wanted to try something else now. The moviedb api looked funny enough. 

So, the idea's I had in mind were:
- Using the Rijksmuseum api again
- Streaming platform like Netflix, HBO.
